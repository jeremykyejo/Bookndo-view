               <h4> How does Bookndo use social media?</h4>
               <p>We use social media to promote our Service Provider partners’ services and to promote, improve and facilitate our own services. For example, we have integrated social media plugins into the Bookndo.com website. So when you click on one of the buttons and register with your social media account, information is shared with your social media provider, and possibly presented on your social media profile to be shared with others in your network.</p>
               <p>
                  In addition to implementing these buttons, Bookndo uses social media by maintaining accounts on several social media sites and by offering social apps. These social media services may allow you to share information with Bookndo. When you register with a social media app, you will be told which information will be shared with Bookndo. The information you choose to share with us may include the basic information that’s available in your social media profile, email address, status updates and your list of friends. This information is necessary to create a unique user experience either in the app itself or on the Website.

               <h3>Cookies</h3>
               <h4>What is a cookie?</h4>
               <p>A cookie is a small amount of data that a website places on your computer.</p>
               <br />
               <h4>Why do websites use cookies?</h4>
               <p>Web pages have no memory. If you are surfing from page to page within a website, you will not be recognised as the same user across pages. Cookies enable your browser to be recognised by the website. So cookies are mainly used to remember the choices you have made – choices such as the language you prefer and the currency you use. They will also make sure you are recognised when you return to a website.</p>
               <br />
               <h4>Do all cookies do the same thing?</h4>
